# Hello, World! :wave:
I'm an artist, educator, and web developer. 

I started out programming games in Unity using C#, and became interested in websites while making net art.

Now I'm focused on front-end development, but I still enjoy all types of code and learning new languages.

I'm currently learning React and plan on adding any future projects I work on here.
